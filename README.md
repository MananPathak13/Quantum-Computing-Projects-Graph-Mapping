# Graph-Mapping Project

This project demonstrates an innovative approach to solving graph-mapping problems using quantum computing techniques. It leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to efficiently find optimal mappings of nodes in one graph to nodes in another, a fundamental challenge in areas such as network theory, computational biology, and social network analysis.

## Overview

Graph mapping, also known as graph isomorphism or subgraph isomorphism, is critical for understanding the structural similarities between different networks. This project explores the application of quantum algorithms to accelerate the graph-mapping process, showcasing the potential of quantum computing in tackling complex computational problems.
